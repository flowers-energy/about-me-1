      Hi, I'm Matt!  I am new to coding but am excited to see where it will take me!  I worked for Verizon for over 15 years as a solutions specialist but recently quit to pursue a new job somewhere in the tech field.  I'm into video games, movies/tv shows, sports, cars, and almost anything tech related.  My favorite brands are Apple and Tesla.  I hope to work in the tech industry sometime in the near future!
