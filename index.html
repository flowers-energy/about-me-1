      <ul>Hi, I'm Matt!  I was born in California and lived there for until I was 2.  I then moved to the Seattle area and have lived there ever since.  I worked for Verizon for over 15 years as a solutions specialist but recently quit to pursue a new career.  I love almost all food, but my favorites are probably pizza and burgers!  I'm into video games, movies/tv shows, sports, cars, and almost anything tech related.  My favorite brands are Apple and Tesla. I am new to coding and am excited to see where it will take me!  I hope to work in the tech industry sometime in the near future!
